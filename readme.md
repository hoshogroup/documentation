# Readme

Welcome to the LivenPay Github.

Here you will find the Ethereum smart contracts used to create and distribute the LivenCoin (LVN) ERC token, as well as documents which detail the LivenPay project.

If you are curious about the project, the most comprehensive source of information is the Whitepaper, found here in /documentation or at <https://livenpay.io>.

To save you some time to get to know the project quickly, you can read this post, [“The](https://medium.com/livenpay/the-ski-lift-pitch-livenpay-in-90-seconds-1c6687f472e1)[ Ski Lift Pitch - LivenPay in 90 Seconds”](https://medium.com/livenpay/the-ski-lift-pitch-livenpay-in-90-seconds-1c6687f472e1)

Otherwise, here are quick-answers to some foundational questions you might have.

## What is Liven?

Liven is a mobile payment and rewards platform where users earn digital currency for paying with the app.

As of October 2018 there are over 350,000 users transacting with the Liven app at hundreds of venues throughout Australia, and Liven is expanding overseas beginning Q1 2019.

## What is LivenPay?

LivenPay is the payment gateway allowing integrated fiat+crypto payments at point of sale.

With LivenPay, users of the Liven app can pay for their bill in fiat and/or LivenCoin - and merchants can receive their revenue in fiat or LivenCoin.

## What is LivenCoin (LVN)?

LivenCoin (LVN) is Liven’s network utility currency used within the Liven network.

## How is LivingCoin (LVN) earned and used?

LVN is rewarded to users whenever they transact in the Liven network. The amount rewarded is a % of the total bill, which is negotiated and agree’d upon between Liven and the merchant.

Upon receiving LVN, it can be immediately donated to charity or tipped to the venue - alternatively it can be stored in the in-app Liven wallet.

## What can you do in the Liven wallet?

With the in-app Liven wallet, users can view how much LVN they have, send or request it from other in the network, or stored in the wallet indefinitely.

Upon ICO completion, LVN can be withdrawn from the Liven ecosystem to external wallets.

## Why is Liven launching an Ethereum token?

Liven is launching LivenCoin (LVN) as an Ethereum token to solve our unique business problems.

Having our internal currency as a borderless Ethereum token allows for immediate overseas expansion, expanded peer-to-peer exchange capabilities and transparent donation features. We also believe we can assist in mainstream cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption.

For further reading on this, we’ve written [“Liven](https://medium.com/livenpay/liven-explains-why-do-we-need-the-blockchain-a3ceb696fa79)[ Explains: Why do we Need the Blockchain”](https://medium.com/livenpay/liven-explains-why-do-we-need-the-blockchain-a3ceb696fa79)

## What makes up the Liven ecosystem?

The Liven ecosystem consists of:

- Users, who discover, pay and earn at merchant partners with the Liven app.
- Merchants, who are part of the always-on marketing solution in the Liven app and payment network LivenPay.
- Charity partners, who receive fiat revenue from LVN user donations
- And eventually, external exchanges where LVN is traded.

## When is the Ethereum blockchain used?

Please see [https://github.com/LivenPay](https://github.com/LivenPay) for up to date information of how Liven is using the Ethereum blockchain.

## What are the transaction speeds of Liven?

Sending LVN peer-to-peer within the Liven network is near instant.

Later on when LVN can be withdrawn from the Liven network, the speeds will be dependent on the Ethereum network’s traffic.

## Project roadmap:

The roadmaps for different areas of the Liven ecosystem can be found in detail in the whitepaper. [https://github.com/LivenPay/documentation](github.com/livenpay/documentation) or <https://livenpay.io>
